<h1>The Best Movies According to Me aka<strong> DEEPAK</strong></h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3> KGF 2</h3>
<p> This is the best action movie I have ever seen. The character i.e., <strong>Rocky</strong> perfectly suited character.</p>
<h3>Satyaprem Ki katha</h3>
<p> a true love-story based movie, a romance for the ages in which man loves unconditionally and accept his partner despite her dilemmas.</p>
<h3>Super 30</h3>
<p>It is a human drama and the story of a teacher who triumphs over the many challanges that life throws at him.</p>
